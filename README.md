### Objective

Using Node and any framework, your task is to build a currency conversion service that includes FIAT and cryptocurrencies.

### Brief

In this challenge, your assignment is to build a service that makes conversions between different currencies. You will connect to an external API to request currency data, log & store requests of your users, and rate limit requests based on specific criteria. Your service must support at least the following currency pairs:

USD
EUR
BTC
ETH

### Tasks

[]   Implement assignment using:

    []   Language: **Node**
    []   Framework: **any framework**

[]   We recommend using the Coinbase API for exchange rates:

    https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#get[]exchange[]rates

[]   Your service should be able to identify users. You may use any form of authentication that you think is suitable for the task (e.g., API keys, Username/Password)
[]   Your service needs to store each request, the date/time it was performed, its parameters and the response body
[]   Each user may perform 100 requests per workday (Monday[]Friday) and 200 requests per day on weekends. After the quota is used up, you need to return an error message
[]   The service must accept the following parameters:
    []   The source currency, the amount to be converted, and the final currency
    []   e.g. `?from=BTC&to=USD&amount=999.20`
[]   Your service must return JSON in a structure you deem fit for the task
[]   BONUS: find a clever strategy to cache responses from the external currency API
